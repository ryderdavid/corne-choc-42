# Project: Corne Choc 42-Key QMK Firmware

## IMPERATIVE: GitHub Authentication

You MUST unset any environment-level work account GitHub secrets (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, etc.) before performing any git push or gh operations. Only use the personal `ryderdavid` GitHub account for this repository. Before pushing, always:

1. Run `unset GITHUB_TOKEN GH_TOKEN` to clear work account tokens
2. Switch gh active account: `gh auth switch --hostname github.com --user ryderdavid`
3. Verify with `gh auth status` that `ryderdavid` is the active account

This is a personal project and must never use work credentials.
